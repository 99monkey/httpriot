@mainpage HTTPRiot - A simple HTTP REST Library

@image html httpriot.png

<a href="http://www.labratrevenge.com/httpriot">HTTPRiot homepage</a>

HTTPRiot is a simple REST library designed to make interacting with REST services 
much easier.  It supports GET, POST, PUSH and DELETE requests in addition to HTTP Basic Authentication.
HTTPRiot was inspired by John Nunemaker's excellent 
<a href="http://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty/tree/master">httparty</a> Ruby library.

    </ul>

<h3>A simple example</h3>
@code
// Returns a dictionary of key vlaues
id person = [HTTPRiotRestModel getPath:@"http://localhost:1234/some/person.json" 
                               options:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"json" forKey:@"format"] 
                                error:nil];
                                
@endcode
<h3>Creating Your Own Models</h3>
The preferred way to use HTTPRiot is to subclass HTTPRiotRestModel and make your own models.
From these models you can set default options that will be used by every request.
@include Tweet.m

<h3>Using Threads</h3>
HTTPRiot uses synchronous requests.  This means you should run these requests in a seperate 
thread.  Apple has made this really easy.

@code
-(void)applicationDidFinishLaunching
{
    [NSThread detachNewThreadSelector:@selector(getSomeResource) toTarget:self withObject:nil];
}

-(void)getSomeResource
{
    NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [NSAutoreleasePool new];
    person = [HTTPRiotRestModel getPath:@"/some/person.json" 
                                options:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"json" forKey:@"format"] 
                                  error:nil];
    [pool release];
    
    [self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(updateUI) withObject:nil waitUntilDone:YES];
}

-(void)updateUI
{
    [self updateGUIWithPerson:person];
}
@endcode

<h3>Handling Errors</h3>
You can handle errors in your requests by supplying an error object to the methods of HTTPRiotRestModel.
The errors will return useful information:
@li <strong><tt>code</tt></strong> - The status code returned by the server.
@li <strong><tt>localizedFailureReason</tt></strong> - The reason the request failed.
@li <strong><tt>localizedDescription</tt></strong> - Description of the failure.
@li <strong><tt>domain</tt></strong> - The error domain.
@li <strong><tt>userInfo</tt></strong> - The userInfo dictionary with error infomration in addition to 
    to any <strong><tt>headers</tt></strong> returned by the server.

@page iphone-setup Using the HTTPRiot Framework in your iPhone Applications

HTTPRiot comes with a simple SDK package that makes it very easy to get up and running quickly 
on the iphone.  You'll need to put this SDK package somewhere where it won't get deleted and you 
can share it with all your iPhone projects.

-# Move the httpriot-* directory to <strong><tt>~/Library/SDKs</tt></strong>.  You might need to create this directory.
   It's not mandatory that it lives in this location, but it's a good idea that you put it somewhere 
   where it can be shared.
-# Create a new project or open an existing project in XCode.  Select your application's target and 
   press<strong class="key"> âŒ˜i</strong> to bring up the properties window.  Set the <strong><tt>Additional SDKs</tt></strong>
   property to <strong><tt>~/Library/SDKs/httpriot-0.1.0/\$(PLATFORM_NAME).sdk</tt></strong>.
   @image html additional-sdks.png
-# Set the <strong><tt>Additional Linker Flags</tt></strong> to <tt>-lhttpriot -ObjC</tt></strong> 
   @image html other-linker-flags.png
-# Use <strong><tt>\#include "HTTPRiot/HTTPRiot.h"</tt></strong> in one of your application's files. 
   That's it!  Now you're ready to use HTTPRiot!

@page cocoa-setup Using the HTTPRiot Framework in your Desktop Applications

-# Right click Other Frameworks in XCode and select <tt>Add &rarr; Existing Frameworks</tt>.  Select 
   the <strong><tt>HTTPRiot.framework</tt></strong> and press <tt>Add</tt>. @image html httpriot-framework.png
-# Include the framework <HTTPRiot/HTTPRiot.h> in your project.  That's it!

<h3>Embedding HTTPRiot.framework in your application</h3>
If you want to distribute HTTPRiot.framework with your application you'll need to do another step.

-# Right click your target name and select <tt>"Add > New Build Phase > New Copy Files Build Phase"</tt>.
   Set <tt>Frameworks</tt> as the destination path in the popup. @image html copy-files.png
-# Drag the HTTPRiot.framework file to this new phase.
