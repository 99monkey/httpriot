@mainpage HTTPRiot - A simple HTTP REST Library

HTTPRiot is a simple REST library designed to make interacting with REST services 
much easier.  It supports GET, POST, PUSH and DELETE requests in addition to HTTP Basic Authentication.
HTTPRiot was inspired by John Nunemaker's excellent 
<a href="http://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty/tree/master">httparty</a> Ruby library.

<h3>A simple example</h3>
@code
// Returns a dictionary of key vlaues
id person = [HTTPRiotRestModel getPath:@"/some/person.json" 
                               options:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"json" forKey:@"format"] 
                                error:nil];
                                
@endcode
<h3>Creating Your Own Models</h3>
The preferred way to use HTTPRiot is to subclass HTTPRiotRestModel and make your own models.
From these models you can set default options that will be used by every request.

@page iphone-setup Using the HTTPRiot Framework in your iPhone Applications

HTTPRiot comes with a simple SDK package that makes it very easy to get up and running quickly 
on the iphone.  You'll need to put this SDK package somewhere where it won't get deleted and you 
can share it with all your iPhone projects.

-# Move the httpriot-* directory to <strong><tt>~/Library/SDKs</tt></strong>.  You might need to create this directory.
   It's not mandatory that it lives in this location, but it's a good idea that you put it somewhere 
   where it can be shared.
-# Create a new project or open an existing project in XCode.  Select your application's target and 
   press<strong class="key"> âŒ˜i</strong> to bring up the properties window.  Set the <strong><tt>Additional SDKs</tt></strong>
   property to <strong><tt>~/Library/SDKs/httpriot-0.1.0/\$(PLATFORM_NAME).sdk</tt></strong>.

-# Set the <strong><tt>Additional Linker Flags</tt></strong> to <tt>-lhttpriot -ObjC</tt></strong> 
   @image html other-linker-flags.png
-# Use <strong><tt>#include "HTTPRiot/HTTPRiot.h"</tt></strong> in one of your application's files and use 
   it per the directions.  Good luck!
